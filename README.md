Freshman Year Software Design Project for ENGR 1181

During my freshman year ENGR 1181 class, I worked alongside 3 other students in order to create a video game in MATLAB. We decided to create a dungeon crawler
style game. In this repository, you will find our source code for the project as well as the documentation we completed in order to explain our software.
